The code is expected to: 
 read an integer that determines which operation to perform (0 for addition, 1 for multiplication 2 for transpose, and 3 for determinant).
 read the dimension of the matrix/matrices (one integer that represents the number of rows and columns in all input matrices).
 read the elements of the input matrix/matrices (two matrices if the operation is addition or multiplication, and one matrix if the operation is transpose or determinant). 
 print the output matrix (or the output value in case of determinant operation).
